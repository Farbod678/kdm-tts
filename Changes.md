Version 1.0
* Population UI removed and replaced with player boards.
* "Pack Survivor" button replaced with "Back to Settlement"
* Player boards now support stacking cards (Fighting Arts/Disorders/Abilities/Injuries) in the same slot. You can use this if a survivor has more cards than available slots.
* Rules now lock when spawned.
* Hunt/Showdown buttons in the timeline now goes directly to showdown/hunt (with a confirmation popup), instead of taking you to the hunt/showdown setup screen.
